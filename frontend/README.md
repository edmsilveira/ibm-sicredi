## BUGS

I've focused on functionalities using ReactJS as library, so on the visual and responsive aspects may not go as expected.
It was a really challenge exercise do this test using React + Redux.

Bugs:

brakpoints greather than 1366px
Quantity doesn't reset on modal close.
Delete product on cart sometimes may crash after a few tests
